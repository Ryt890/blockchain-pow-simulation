# Proof-of-Work Blockchain Simulation

This repository contains a minimal implementation of a Proof-of-Work blockchain,
designed to experimentally analyze mining difficulty, hash attempts, and block
generation time.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to understand how Proof-of-Work behaves under different
parameters such as mining difficulty and nonce selection strategies, through direct
simulation rather than theoretical discussion.

## Current Features
- Proof-of-Work mining with adjustable difficulty
- Timestamped blocks with reproducible hashing
- Chain validation
- Runtime and attempt count measurement

## Planned Experiments
- Difficulty vs average hash attempts
- Distribution of block generation time
- Nonce randomness and bias analysis
- Difficulty changes and fork behavior
